            <p>In Tulu Nadu,  <em>Kori Katta</em> (In Tulu ) or <em>Korida Katta / Koli Anka</em> (in Kannada) - cockfighting wasn't just a sport - it was an art form and a tradition. Fighting cocks were treated like champion athletes! They had special food, special training, and even their own astrology book called &quot;<em>Kukkuta Panchanga</em>&quot; that told their owners which day was lucky for a fight!</p>
            </p>
            <h4 dir="ltr"><strong>The Kai Ronka - A Chicken's Royal Cup</strong></h4>
            <p>Look at this small coconut shell cup. It's called &quot;Kai Ronka,&quot; and it was used specifically to give water to fighting cocks.</p>
            <p>Why couldn't the rooster just drink from any old bowl? Because these weren't ordinary chickens! They were respected warriors. The Kai Ronka was carefully made so the rooster could drink comfortably without spilling water or getting its feathers wet. Think of it like this: if you were training for the Olympics, you'd want proper equipment, right? The fighting cock got the same respect!            </p>
            <h4 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-1b2c008f-7fff-345a-4c16-51c234653c7f">The Champion's Life</strong></h4>
            <p dir="ltr">Fighting cocks belonged to the educated people of communities like <em>Banta</em> and <em>Billava</em>. These roosters were fed paddy, but unlike the regular chickens this would be of high quality.</p>
            <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-1b2c008f-7fff-345a-4c16-51c234653c7f">Fun Fact: </strong> If a rooster won 12 fights, it would get a special honor - a bath in the sea! And if a rooster lost and died in a fight, its owner would never cook it for curry because that would be shameful.<br> 
            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">The care given to these birds shows how much Tulu culture valued discipline, respect, and tradition - even for animals!</p>
