             <h4 dir="ltr">The Magical Three-Eyed Coconut</h4>
             <p dir="ltr">Have you ever noticed that a coconut has three dark spots that look like eyes? In Tulu culture, people believed these &quot;eyes&quot; were special and magical!<br>
             When a baby was born, mothers would take a coconut shell and make a small hole in one of these three eyes. Then they would fill it with warm water and gently pour it over the newborn baby. Why? Because pouring water directly from a pot might be too harsh for a tiny baby's soft skin. The coconut shell lets the water trickle out slowly and gently, like a natural baby shower!</p>
            <h4 dir="ltr">The Sacred Cradle</h4>
            <p dir="ltr"> Look at this beautiful wooden cradle! It might look simple, but it's actually very special. Traditional Tulu cradles were made from 5 or 9 different types of wood. Each type of wood was chosen carefully to protect the baby and bring good luck. Here's something amazing: the same craftspeople who made these cradles were from communities like the<em> Koraga, Mugera, Billava, Banta, Mugaveera</em>, and <em>Ulala</em> - the original residents of Tulu Nadu. They were masters at working with wood!</p>
