            <h4 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-7af42699-7fff-f3ae-3478-9d9f28a367c0">The &quot;Sout&quot; - The Coconut Shell Ladle</strong></h4>
            <p dir="ltr">This curved coconut shell with a handle is called &quot;Sout&quot;. It was the most important tool in a Tulu kitchen!             The Sout could do almost everything:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Scoop rice from the pot or pour sambar (spicy lentil soup) into bowls</li>
              <li>Measure milk</li>
              <li>Pour oil for cooking</li>
              <li>Even used as a bowl for drinking!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-7af42699-7fff-f3ae-3478-9d9f28a367c0">The Magic of Being Leak-Proof</strong></h4>
            <p dir="ltr">Here's what's amazing: when made correctly, not a single drop of liquid would leak from a coconut shell ladle! How did they do it? It required incredible skill. The craftsperson had to:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Choose the right coconut (not too young, not too old)</li>
              <li>Cut it perfectly in half</li>
              <li>Sand it smooth so there were no cracks</li>
              <li>Attach a handle without breaking it</li>
              <li>Make sure all the natural fibers were sealed</li>
            </ol>
            <p dir="ltr">The hardest part was attaching a handle made from bamboo or wood. The craftsperson would carefully make a small hole in the thick coconut shell and attach the handle so strongly that it would never fall off, even after years of use in hot, steaming kitchens!</p>
            <h4 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-7af42699-7fff-f3ae-3478-9d9f28a367c0">The Bannangayu Secret</strong></h4>
            <p dir="ltr">Sometimes coconut shells were too hard and would crack while working on them. Tulu people discovered a clever solution: they'd take a &quot;Bannangayu&quot; - a coconut that hadn't fully grown yet - and soak it in hot water and boil it. Guess what happened? It became as flexible as rubber! You could bend it any direction you wanted. This made it much easier to shape and cut without breaking.</p>
            <p dir="ltr"> Even ordinary people could learn to make these ladles. It wasn't just for experts! Anyone with patience and skill could create these useful tools. Before plastic and steel took over, every Tulu home had several coconut shell ladles hanging in the kitchen!</p>
