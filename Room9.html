            <p dir="ltr">Tulu people have always believed that our world is filled with both good and bad spiritual forces. While there are kind gods and goddesses who protect us, there are also evil spirits that might want to harm people or cause trouble.            </p>
            <p>This practice is called &quot;Tarayid Bandhamalapane&quot; . The name sounds complicated, but it basically means &quot;catching evil spirits to protect people and places.&quot;</p>
            <p>When someone felt they were being bothered by evil forces - maybe they were getting sick a lot, or having bad luck, or feeling scared - they would call for help from someone who knew how to perform this protective ritual.</p>
            <p>The coconut shell were used like spiritual traps or shields. Think of them like magical bug catchers, but instead of catching bugs, they were meant to catch or block bad spiritual energy. All the troubles of a suffering person were put in the coconut so that it should not disturb them again in future.</p>
            <p> In Tulu tradition, spiritual healers and religious leaders were highly respected. They were like doctors, but for spiritual problems. And the humble coconut was one of their most important tools! </p>
