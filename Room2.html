            <p>Step into the traditional Tulu kitchen, where mothers prepare special food for their little ones!</p>
            <h4>Feeding Time!</h4>
            <p>When babies were old enough to eat solid food (usually during a special ceremony called Annaprashan), they needed their rice mashed up into soft, tiny pieces. But there were no electric blenders back then! So how did families do it? </p>
            <h4>Three Different Ways, Three Different Lives</h4>
            <p>Poor Farming Families: Imagine a simple clay pot with cooked rice and a pinch of salt. The mother would take a piece of coconut shell and use it as a masher, crushing the rice until it was soft enough for the baby to eat. Sometimes they'd add a tiny bit of ghee (clarified butter) to make it tastier. The same coconut that gave them water to drink also helped them feed their children!</p>
            <p>Middle-Class Families: These families had a special wooden tool which was used to grind the food. It was carved from wood by skilled craftsmen, especially from the Vishwakarma community. This grinder made the work easier and faster.</p>
            <p>Rich Families: Wealthy families used fancy grinders made of copper! These shiny metal tools would grind the rice smoothly, and they'd often add milk to make it extra nutritious and delicious.</p>
