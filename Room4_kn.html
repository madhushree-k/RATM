            <p dir="ltr">Enter carefully! This room holds the weapons of tiny warriors.</p>

            <p dir="ltr">This small, sharp blade is called &quot;Balu,&quot; and it was tied to a fighting cock's leg during a match. But don't think it was just tied on carelessly! Creating and attaching this blade was serious business.            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">Special craftsmen called Acharyas (particularly from the Kavinakelse community) would make these blades one by one, with incredible care. Each blade was unique and perfectly balanced. The knife had to be sharp enough to be effective but designed so carefully that it would hit only specific spots - the opponent's eye, neck, or heart. This wasn't about being cruel; it was about skill and precision, like a martial art.            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">Not just anyone could tie the Balu to a rooster's leg! It required special training and delicate hands. The blade had to be tied at exactly the right angle so that when the rooster moved forward to attack, the blade would strike accurately.Tie it wrong, and it wouldn't work. Tie it too tight, and you'd hurt your own rooster. It was all about balance and knowledge passed down through generations.</p>
            <h4 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-462f4226-7fff-ba2f-ea7c-9b5d4a48e2c8">Two Types of Fighters</strong></h4>
            <p dir="ltr">There were &quot;Vatte Kori&quot; and &quot;Bante Kori&quot; - different types of fighting roosters from different communities. Each had their own style and technique!</p>
            <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> In old times, not everyone was allowed to tie the Balu or train fighting cocks. It was a respected skill, and only certain people had the knowledge. The roosters themselves were shown so much respect that they had a special gap left in their neck feathers to keep them comfortable during fights!
