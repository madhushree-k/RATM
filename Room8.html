            <p dir="ltr">Welcome to the storage room, where Tulu farmers kept their most precious treasure - seeds for the next planting season!            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">Imagine you're a farmer. You've worked hard all season to grow rice, and finally, you harvest it. You save some seeds to plant next year. But there's a big problem: tiny worms and insects LOVE to eat stored seeds! If your seeds get destroyed, you can't plant crops next year, and your family might go hungry.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">So what did Tulu farmers do before we had chemical pesticides and fancy storage bags?</p>
            <h4 dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-088d136e-7fff-bb0f-8a33-a865ac395a3c">The Coconut Shell Ash Solution</strong></h4>
            <p dir="ltr">Tulu farmers discovered that the ash from burned coconut shells had special powers to protect seeds! Here's how they did it:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Step 1: Burn coconut shells until they turn into hot ash<strong dir="ltr">&nbsp;</strong></li>
              <li>Step 2: Mix the seeds with this hot coconut shell ash&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Step 3: Put the mixture into a clay pot&nbsp;</li>
              <li>Step 4: Cover the pot with cow dung and place in sunlight<strong dir="ltr">&nbsp;</strong></li>
              <li>Step 5: Store it away safely            </li>
            </ul>
            <p dir="ltr">Even after YEARS, the seeds would stay perfect! No worms, no rot, no damage. The coconut shell ash acted like a natural pesticide and preservative. The seeds would be ready to plant whenever the farmer needed them.            </p>
            <p dir="ltr">The ash did several things:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Kept moisture away (worms love damp places)</li>
              <li>The ash itself might have had chemicals that affected insects</li>
              <li>The sealed pot kept air and bugs out</li>
              <li>The ash absorbed any extra moisture</li>
            </ul>
            <p dir="ltr">Today, farmers use chemical fertilizers and pesticides to protect their seeds. But these chemicals can sometimes harm the soil and the environment. The old Tulu way was completely natural! The coconut tree provided protection even after it had given its fruit. Nothing was wasted, and nothing harmful was added to the earth.</p>
